# RN-Firebase_Login_and_CRUD
 Firebase Login and CRUD operations
 
# Getting Started (with Expo)
If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:

git clone https://github.com/cnrsbtogll/RN-Firebase-Login-and-CRUD.git

cd RN-Firebase-Login-and-CRUD

expo start

# Getting Started (without Expo)
If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:

git clone https://github.com/cnrsbtogll/RN-Firebase-Login-and-CRUD.git

cd RN-Firebase-Login-and-CRUD

expo eject

npm install

react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
